Coding outdoors is one of those things you try because it sounds good, but you immediately regret. In theory, coding outdoors is relaxing. In practice, the realities of an uncontrolled environment quickly become obvious.

Some things you'll encounter:
- sun glare
- wind
- bugs
- battery runs out

When the MacBook Pro was announced with the XDR display, the first thing I thought was "I can code outdoors now".

The first thing I noticed is that although the screen is capable of 1000 nits, I could only access half of that: 500 nits.

[Vivid](https://www.getvivid.app) comes out and solves this problem. But now there's two new ones:

1. My screen gets uncomfortably hot, especially in the summer, even in the shade.
2. The battery runs out much faster.

For the first issue, you wanna be in some shade. It may seem this sort of defeats the purpose of being outside. But the difference in brightness between inside and outside is still massive.

I solve the second issue with a portable USB-C power bank.



Tips:
- Macbook Pro 16" with XDR display
- Microfiber cloth
- Vivid (app) to unlock the brightness



Things to try:
- Diffusion screen
