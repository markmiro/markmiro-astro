People want to eat and they want to be healthy. When you go to the grocery store, you'll see raw ingredients like carrots and heads of lettuce for like $1-2. And that's at the grocery store. If you try in-season foods, you can visit a farm, load up your car, they'll weigh the car when you arrive and again when you leave, and you'll pay for the difference.

But when you try to feed yourself, you have options, but they're not that great for what you're paying for. You can buy raw ingredients, but then you still have to cook them, and that takes education, skill, time, and equipment. Or you can eat out, but that's also pricy, unless you get smart about what you're buying. You can buy a big pizza slice in some places for $4. If you can make all 3 meals that price and we're assuming it's 700 calories for a slice, then you've got 1/3 of your calories for the day in that meal. This is a good deal considering no prep. Only issue is nutrition.

Now, when it comes to eating, and especially if you have a computer job, the worst part of the pizza is the bread. If you're working on your feet, you absolutely need the bread calories just to get through the day. But want a cheap meal for your office job? Want to avoid the afternoon slump? You gotta get creative.

You can get a packet of salmon from Trader Joes for $6. That's about 300 calories. If you add 2 tbsp of cream cheese for 100, and add a slice of bread for 80, you're now at 480 calories. Still not a lot. And at that point you've paid quite a bit to get a barely over half the calories you need. And worse—you're still assembling it yourself. Smoked salmon comes out to $32 a pound—expensive!

If you eat a can of refried beans, that's $2 from Raleys. And that'll get you almost 500 calories. But nobody's gonna down a whole can of beans. I can get 2 McDonald's Sausage McMuffin sandwiches for $5. Each one is 400 calories. So 800 calories for $5. That's pretty good.

Let's zoom out. Here's some metrics that I want to hit. We're trying to hit 2000 calories per day. We're trying to get all the nutrients we need. And we want to do that in the ballpark of $500 a month with minimal time spent prepping meals. Any food startup that wants to be a go-to for meals should not ignore people's budgets. So I'm going to assume a couple things that won't seem to make sense.

First, we're gonna assume the average customer will consume all 3 of their meals from our startup. This sounds bizarre. I like In-N-Out but I'll rarely eat their food more than 2x in a given week, let alone every meal. But the reason I don't flinch at paying for In-N-Out is their burgers are cheap. You get a lot of food for very little money. So even if nobody in their right mind will consume every meal from our startup, we shouldn't expect them to regularly break their budget to make exception for us. Ideally, we want to surprise our customers by giving them more and better nutrition within their budget.

Second, we don't want to starve our customers. I like the [glucose goddess](https://www.glucosegoddess.com/) on this. She's [not totally right](https://abbylangernutrition.com/the-glucose-goddess-review-are-her-7-hacks-legit/) on everything, though. She believes we overeat and have brain fog because we'll consume a sugary breakfast, this will spike our insulin, then cause a sugar crash, causing us to crave more sugar, and we'll be on this roller coaster for the entire day if we start off wrong. She recommends a savory breakfast. And if you are going to eat carbs, prep yourself with a veggie starter and something acidic like vinegar. In short, she's recommending a salad with vinegar dressing. Add some olive oil and salt and you've got yourself a meal.

And of course we want to throw in enough variety so we're not eating the same sludge for every meal. We don't want to forget to factor in travel and wait time.

Trifecta is a local company that makes healthy meals and advertises quality ingredients. But these come out to about $15 per meal, and you still have to heat them up. Paying 3x more than McDonald's for healthier meals might be worth it, but each meal is only 440 calories. So they're more like 5x the price of McDonald's. There's got to be a better way. If you tried to hit 2000 calories, Trifecta would be getting you there for $400 a month, and that's for half a meal per day. Trifecta sells themselves as a weight-loss option—and I can see why. Look at their incentives. The less calories they put on your plate per dollar, the more money they make. This is a feature of their business that they are proud of.

Let's get to the fundamentals of what the raw ingredients cost and see if we can do better. If we could find a way to make the math work out for cooking beef, we can make it work out for pretty much any other ingredient. Beef is expensive. We eat 3x a day. We want about 700 calories per meal to hit 2000 calories per day.

There's about [1100 calories](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=76&contentid=23572-2) in 80% lean ground beef. And that's [$7 at Raleys](https://www.raleys.com/product/10301999/ground-beef-80-lean-large-pack). Beef is considered to be a more expensive form of protein. That's 157 calories per dollar, or about $5 for 700 calories. These are McDonald's prices! Instead of waiting 5 min in their drive-thru, there's presumably a way to cook it in 5 min? Maybe mass-cook a bunch of meat and heat it up again right when you need it? We need to workshop this some more, but you can see that from raw materials alone, $5 meals seem workable.

**Overhead costs**

Suppose we want to have 1 employee make $10,000 a month. And suppose that employee is me. I'm a company of 1 person and I want to see how many people I have to feed to make $10,000 a month. This would mean I'd have to make about $500 dollars a day, assuming I only work workdays and it's a regular 9-5. Let's assume the average meal costs $5 to make, and I charge $7. This is a little pricier than McDonald's per calorie. If someone for some forsaken reason wanted to eat all their weekday meals from me, it would be 7 * 3 * 20 or about $420 a month. This is about what I might expect to pay for groceries in a given month. If you also want to eat from me on weekends, that would be an additional $210 per month.

In total, it would be $630 per month, which is quite a lot. But let's factor in convenience. Let's assume an customer would spend an extra 5 minutes if preparing the meal themselves. This is generous. It would probably take longer, but let's go with it for now. That comes out to 450 minutes (5 minutes * 30 days * 3 meals) or 7.5 hours a month. That's practically an entire workday. If our average customer is making $5,000 a month, that's $250 per month in time spent on food prep. Spending a day making food is costing our average customer $250 in time alone. A lot of people are working salary positions, so that food prep time doesn't really work out that way, but it's still worth considering.

Now how about our single employee kitchen, what do the economics look like there? This single employee, to make $10,000 a month, would need to be making $500 a day, as we saw. Assume each meal sells for $7 but costs $5 to make, so $2 of profit per meal. Profit margins like this are a rare breed in the food business. Still, he'd need to feed 250 people each workday to make his $10,000 a month. What I mean is this one person should be able to spend 8 hours of time grocery shopping, cooking, research, accounting, etc. and all that work should result in 250 people getting fed that day. That's 30 people an hour, or a person every 2 minutes. These are absurd numbers. But I'm an engineer, and we haven't said anything about what meals we're going to make, or how we're going to automate things. We just know we want good nutritious raw ingredients and we want to process / cook this food economically enough that the math works out.

One thing we want to do is limit the menu. The smaller the menu, as In-N-Out can attest, the easier it is to automate and streamline the entire operation. And this all means lower costs because our overhead is low. The first sacrifice we might need to make is variety. We can't reasonably expect to serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner since each of these would likely require different ingredients and automations. People are great at improvising and using the same limited set of tool in a number of ways. But this also means these employees need to be more skilled and we'd need more of them.

You want to give your chefs high quality raw ingredients, knives, pots and pans, a fridge, and some spatulas? You're saving money on equipment, but you're going to be paying for the finesse with which they use their limited tools. Do you want to save money on overhead? You've got to trade that off with simple meals and machines which require more up-front investment than the cost of a good chef's knife and pan.

If there's a brick and mortar location for this food startup, we want to make sure it's making money all day long and that means breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Rent is usually a monthly payment. This startup needs to be making the most of that rent that it possibly can. It needs to be the Apple of the food business. Apple is great at making more money per sq. foot than anything else in the mall. Premium doesn't mean premium ingredients. Apple likes to sell you aluminum as a premium product, which it most definitely is not. We want this for food. People are health conscious and cheap. Subway had their famous $5 footlongs at one point. But these are carb-heavy meals. Carbs cause a spike and a crash in blood sugar.

Another thing we want to do to make meals worth the cost is pair up nutrients in just the right way. For example, Calcium will limit the absorption of iron. So if you eat enough cheese with your meat, you might not be getting the amount of iron you think you're getting. Pairing iron with Vitamin C will help absorption. So what we wanna do is swap out the orange american cheese for orange juice. Hamburgers with cheese are an American classic, it's delicious, it brings in customers, but needs to stop. Try to picture how clean you'd feel if your lunch consisted of a cucumber salad w/ vinegar and olive oil, half a pound of steak, and a mandarin for dessert.

How about a peanut butter, banana, and milk smoothie. An expensive organic jar from Once Again is $9, but you get 15 servings at 190 calories, so 2,800 or so calories total. This expensive peanut butter is cheaper than McDonald's.

Peanut butter is healthy and has lots of nutrients, but if you look at [this]() chart, buckwheat is even better. And of course you probably don't want buckwheat because you're not used to eating it. But we're a dedicated startup and we need to find a way to make people like it. I grew up with it so I like it. My 6yo daughter likes it. I think more people would like it too if they had it as kids. In any case, let's look at the pricing and get back to this.

Buckwheat is $10 for 1600 total calories on Amazon. And that's the organic kind that costs double what some cheap on sale buckwheat costs from Walmart. Maybe it's because they're trying to get rid of their buckwheat? They have too much?

There are a few further considerations here with our startup. Since we're trying to make cheap nutritious meals, we should consider targeting kids and baby food. Maybe instead of going for the adult market, we instead target kids and the elderly. We make nutritious Gerber-style mash. I have some hesitations, though. The mash has to be good enough for adults to eat and I don't see any way of getting adults to eat baby mash. But let's suppose this food startup is like a fast-food joint and we offer baby-mash versions of our meals. The operational complexity here is low. Buy a couple blenders and we're good to add the baby mash to the menu! One thing—we probably wanna separate some of the ingredients into separate mashes. Imagine if we were mixing a hamburger. That would be disgusting. But mashing just the meat patty and serving it with ketchup and bread is reasonable. I'm not sure what to do with the lettuce. The great thing is adults will have more trust in these mashes since these will be adult meals that just happen to be blended.

If you've done any shopping you'll know how much the price of an ingredient might fluctuate. This poses a big problem. Ideally we want to be flexible enough to take advantage of discounts by serving seasonal ingredients, and also adapting changes in harvests.

If you think about what cooking is, we're usually either boiling some water and putting stuff in it, grilling, or baking. Food is cut into slices for sandwiches and into squares for soups. Grilling and especially baking are great when you want to cook bigger pieces of meat and vegetables. Many cooking methods require cook times on the order of tens of minutes to hours. Cheap ingredients and especially cheap meats require longer cook times. And all of that means that our food startup will probably have to be a soup kitchen.

You can get soups from grocery stores. And these soups often cost something in the $5-7 range. The [steakhouse chili w/ beans](https://www.safeway.com/shop/product-details.970093553.html) is $6 for 420 calories, which is a bit pricy. It comes to about $6 per pound. But the second ingredient is beef. It really is a beef chili. The ingredients are reasonable. Maybe a dollar worth of bread and a couple tbsp of olive oil can fix this. That would be say 80 calories for bread and [260](https://www.target.com/p/california-olive-ranch-global-blend-extra-virgin-olive-oil-25-4-fl-oz/-/A-15274147?afid=google&ref=tgt_adv_xsf&CPNG=Bakery+Deli&adgroup=261-3) for the olive oil.

So far soups are looking really promising. They can be made in large batches. They store well. They can be served in easy-to-clean reusable ceramic bowls (if we want to limit microplastics) or sold cold in plastic (probably fine?). We can stamp a date for when each batch was created to ensure customers are getting a fresh product. Making mash variants seems reasonable. A mash of beef and beans hopefully isn't going to gross anybody out. It's also possible to introduce medium mash just blending for less time. This would be great for kids as they get older—an easy win for not much additional effort. There can be different container sizes too and you pay by weight. Personally I hate the ladle approach that people usually have at salad bars. The ladle will fall in, someone will sneeze, etc. These things require a lot of trust to work. We want customers to be delighted by the food they're about to consume, not grossed out.

So far I'm not sure if this food startup will be a meal kit, a brick and mortar location, whether it might be located in a mall, a business district, if we're going to offer business catering, or DoorDash deliveries. It might even be a website. After all, my goal here is to get nutrition for cheap. And if the website is nothing but some text that says "go to Safeway and buy their steakhouse chili" then so be it. The goal is to get cheap nutrition, and limit carbs. The business has to be cheap to run since more overhead means more costs passed on to the customer and smaller profits.

Serve the wealthy first? This model can work as it has for Apple and Tesla. You start with a premium product and then find ways to distill and automate until it's within reach for most people. But you have to start with something good. If it's not good, you can't distill it. The premium meal kits have some advantage. Regardless, all these meal kits still feel cheap. Why?Baked goods lend themselves to automation in a way that a stir fry doesn't. Baked goods are best fresh, but they still transport well and still taste great even when cold.

Events? If you want to serve 250 people in a day and make $2 per meal you're probably looking to cater. And if you're catering, this puts you in a completely different kind of food business. People want pretty and flavorful, not healthy, and not calories per dollar. The entire point of a party is to treat your guests. You're not going to get repeat customers if your catering business makes all the guests miserable.

Some ways to ameliorate:

1. Smoked brisket. Give guests big cuts of meat
2. Soups. Especially for weddings, it seems nice and can be done in large batches.
3. Potatoes over bread

Now the other issue is if you want to cater to companies, wouldn't you want to just start there? At events and weddings, you probably want more carbs than at a desk job. But if you do, you're playing the cost game, not the flavor game. You will tend to have unhappy customers. There's a reason why employees will often eat out even when food is catered.

Many fast food places offer catering. I think this is the way to go. If you have a restaurant that people naturally go to for lunch, it's much easier to convince people to use you for catering. The balance here is that any food business that goes for nutrition and not flavor will try to make up for lost sales by pushing business lunch catering. Any business that optimizes flavor at the expense of nutrition will probably have an easier time with both the restaurant business and business catering likely won't suffer.

We have to remember that even hospitals have really poor food options. People like healthy food in theory, but there's so much effort that would have to go into making that work. Bryan Johnson has a promising model. He leans on personal brand, being very open about the data he collects on himself. His cocoa powder is touted as having the lowest heavy metal content of anything out there.

It's possible that even if the food tastes ok and isn't addictive, it could still make money on making people feel good about eating it.
