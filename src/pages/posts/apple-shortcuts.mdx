I've been using Apple's shortcuts more lately.

Some things I've tried:
* Kill processes
* Control my lights
* Give me eye breaks
* Move windows around

## Kill processes

I have a YubiKey I use to sign my commits. However, the app sometimes needs to be restarted. I made a shortcut to kill the process and restart it. This works every time.

## Control my lights

This requires some wireless remote control, and somewhere along the line between the wireless connection between my phone, my router, and the hub, it stops working.

## Give me eye breaks

I've been trying this lately to automate the 20-20-20 system. Every 20 minutes, I'll take a 20 second break and look about 20 feet away.

## Which ones work reliably?

About half of them.
