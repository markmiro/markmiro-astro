## Summary

Resume built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, and deployed on Vercel as a static site.

It's generated from this yaml file.

Why? Because I originally designed my resume in Figma here, but the PDF export creates files that are multiple megabytes in size. The exported version of my new resume is 175kb.

I've tested printing and exporting to PDF with Chrome on macOS. It doesn't work well with Safari (iOS and macOS).

I've tried printing in Safari on both iOS and macOS and the results are not as good.
