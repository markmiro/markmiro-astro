## Summary

I built this app to get more experience with Tailwind CSS and a few other libraries that are becoming more popular in the React ecosystem. I also wanted to try out the new NextAuth library, which is a great way to add authentication to your Next.js app.

The stack is close to the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg), except I'm not using tRPC.

## Learnings

Some interactions are a bit slow. I suspect it's because I'm using a free database (Railway) and free function hosting (Vercel). React query could bypass the issue by doing optimistic updates, and syncing to the backend in the background.

Dragging to reorder items would be a nice addition.
