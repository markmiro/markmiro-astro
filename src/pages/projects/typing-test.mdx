## Goals

I was initially inspired by seeing people using 10fastfingers and wanting something that was a little cleaner.

<S3Image src="projects/typing-test/10fastfingers.com_typing-test_english.png" />

I googled around to see what else was out there and none of the other typing test apps were very appealing.

## Solution

My initial version was quite simple:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/typing-test-b55zi?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview"
  style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  title="typing-test"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

After I had the basics working, I decided to get authentication working.

I used this app as an opportunity to learn how to do some things that I had been wanting to learn for a while:

- Firebase
- User authentication
- Chakra UI

## Learnings

I considered building many features. I explored quite a few of them.

1. Replay typed words:

{/* <S3Image src="projects/typing-test/replay-typed-words.png" /> */}

<S3Video src="projects/typing-test/replay-typed-words.mp4" />

2. Show the user's typing speed over time:
