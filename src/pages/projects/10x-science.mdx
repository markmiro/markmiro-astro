## Summary

The goal is to collect results that are so significant theyâ€™re hard to believe, rather
than just significant enough to be believable. There are lots of places with results like this: "if you do X, you'll improve Y by 5%."

The site was easy to set up. I chose [Notion](https://notion.so) because I have it on my phone and desktop and it's easy to add 10x studies as I see them. I used [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com) because I was already a little familiar with it, and I saw [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com) using it.
