import Card from "@/components/Card.astro";

It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:

- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!

## Introduction

I can link internally to [my conclusion](#conclusion) on the same page when writing Markdown.

## Conclusion

I can use the URL `https://my-domain.com/page-1/#introduction` to navigate directly to my Introduction on the page.

<div class="not-prose">
  <Card href="/" title="home" body="Go home" />
</div>
